# Will My Insurance Rates Go Up If I Make a PIP Claim in Utah?

“If I use my PIP benefits after a car crash in Salt Lake City, will my insurance company raise my rates?”

This resource answers that question under Utah law, citing both the PIP statute and the rate-regulation provision that protects no-fault claimants.

## Legal Summary

### Utah Code § 31A-22-307 — Mandatory PIP Coverage  
> “Every insurance policy providing personal injury protection as required by this part shall provide for the payment of benefits as specified in this part to the persons described in Subsection (2)… regardless of fault for the accident.”  [oai_citation:0‡Findlaw](https://codes.findlaw.com/ut/title-31a-insurance-code/ut-code-sect-31a-19a-212/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

All Utah auto policies must include at least \$3,000 in no-fault PIP benefits covering medical expenses, lost wages, funeral costs, and replacement services.

### Utah Code § 31A-19a-212 — Prohibition on Rate Increases for No-Fault Claims  
> “Each rate, rating schedule, and rating manual filed for personal lines insurance may not permit a premium increase due to… (b) a claim under a policy of insurance covering a motor vehicle or the operation of a motor vehicle resulting from any incident… in which the person named in the policy… is not at fault.”  [oai_citation:1‡Findlaw](https://codes.findlaw.com/ut/title-31a-insurance-code/ut-code-sect-31a-19a-212/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

This statute bars insurers from raising your premium when you file a no-fault PIP (or similar) claim in which you bear no responsibility.

## Legal Analysis

1. **No-Fault Coverage**  
   Using PIP is a statutorily protected, no-fault benefit. Filing a PIP claim does not establish fault and therefore does not trigger a rate increase under § 31A-19a-212.

2. **Fault-Based Rate Changes**  
   Insurers may lawfully raise your rates only if you are determined to be at fault for the accident. Utah follows a modified comparative-fault system (Utah Code § 78B-5-818).

3. **CLUE Reporting and Underwriting Practices**  
   PIP claims are reported in CLUE. While insurers may internally review loss history, they cannot impose a surcharge or rate increase on no-fault claims.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can my insurer still raise my rates after I use PIP?**  
No, not for a no-fault PIP claim. Utah Code § 31A-19a-212 explicitly prohibits such increases.

**Q: What if I was partially at fault?**  
Then the incident is not fully “no-fault.” Rate adjustments may follow traditional fault-based underwriting and comparative-fault allocation.

**Q: Does using PIP affect my ability to bring a liability claim later?**  
No. PIP is separate from liability claims. You retain all rights to sue for damages beyond PIP under Utah Code § 31A-22-309(1)(a).

**Q: Can my insurer penalize me for multiple PIP claims?**  
Not by raising rates for no-fault incidents. However, an insurer could non-renew your policy or adjust eligibility if there is evidence of abuse or fraud.
